### Zen Blocks

Quick development environment for creating gutenberg blocks using Docker and create-guten-block.

I've also created some gutenberg blocks in this project.

## Dev Environment

Spinning up the dev environment is easy. Just run

`docker-compose up --build` on first run. This will spin up a docker container with wordpress installed and the plugins folder will be mounted on to wordpress
